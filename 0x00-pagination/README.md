Pagination is a common technique used to display a large set of data in smaller, more manageable chunks, typically on a website or in an application. In Python, you can implement pagination for your data using libraries like Flask for web applications or simply by working with lists of data.
When paginating a dataset with hypermedia metadata, you typically use Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS) principles. HATEOAS allows you to include links and metadata in your paginated response to guide the client on how to navigate through the paginated data. In practice, this is often used in RESTful APIs.
